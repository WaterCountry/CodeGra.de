    An important note about naming in this class: most of the attribute names
    are not really intuitive. For example: *supporting* ``set_deadline`` means
    that we probably don't get the deadline from the LMS. This has two main
    reasons: 1) legacy: these strange names mirror the names used in our LTI
    1.1 classes, and 2) it describes what you can do inside CodeGrade with the
    LMS, maybe it is in the future possible to sync back the deadline to the
    LMS, and in this case the name ``set_deadline`` makes way more sense.

        Canvas does now. If set to ``None`` this LMS doesn't have any post

        Some LMSes do not provide both the ``iss`` and the ``client_id`` in all

        :class:`psef.models.LTI1p3Provider` is not always correct (especially
        as the ``iss`` often gets used multiple times). For some LMSes
        therefore it is a better idea to simply include the id of the provider
        in the launch url, and verify with the given information that the
        provider could theoretically be the correct one (i.e. all given
        information matches with the information in the LTI provider that
        belongs to the ``id``).

        This really is a workaround, so if we know for sure that all needed

        should set this to ``False``.
